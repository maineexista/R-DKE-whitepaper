# 🧬 Biologically-Inspired Loop — R-DKE v2.0 (Physarum-Inspired Architecture)

## Overview

This document explains the **Physarum-inspired reasoning loop** that powers **R-DKE v2.0**,  
a biologically-inspired extension of the Recursive Deep Knowledge Engine.

Instead of treating uncertainty as an error, this version treats it as **fuel** —  
a nutrient that drives exploration and discovery.  
The design borrows directly from the behavior of *Physarum polycephalum*,  
a slime mold capable of solving complex problems without a brain,  
through distributed chemical signaling and adaptive path formation.

## 🧠 Biological Analogy

| Physarum Behavior | R-DKE Equivalent |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Nutrient source attracts protoplasmic flow | Uncertainty attracts reasoning activity |
| Tubes thicken along efficient nutrient paths | Knowledge edges strengthen along verified truths |
| Inefficient tubes decay and disappear | Weak or false reasoning decays |
| Network self-organizes into optimal transport graph | Knowledge graph self-organizes into optimal reasoning structure |
| Distributed coordination without central control | Distributed curiosity loops operating in parallel |

Physarum does not "search" — it **grows** into solutions.  
R-DKE adopts this same approach for knowledge evolution.

## 🔁 The Physarum Loop in R-DKE

The loop connects directly to the **Truth Graph** and **Curiosity Loop** stages from v1.0.
