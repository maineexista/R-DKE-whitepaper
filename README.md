# Recursive Deep Knowledge Engine (R-DKE)

**Concept Author:** Marius Gherasim  
**AI Assistant:** GPT-5  

R-DKE proposes a machine intelligence architecture capable of *instant deep research*, achieved by continuously compressing global knowledge into meaning representations, verifying truth states, and recursively deepening understanding through autonomous curiosity loops.

This framework outlines:

✅ Semantic knowledge atoms  
✅ Truth-graph epistemic memory  
✅ Autonomous self-questioning + exploration cycle  
✅ Pre-computed reasoning for millisecond answers  
✅ Transparent evidence + counter-view synthesis

## Vision

A shift from reactive AI → **proactive intelligence**

> “Not a system that waits to be asked.  
A system that asks questions first.”

Future work will explore prototypes, evaluation metrics, and safety systems.
