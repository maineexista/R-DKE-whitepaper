# Recursive Deep Knowledge Engine (R-DKE)

**Concept Author:** Marius Gherasim  
**AI Assistant:** GPT-5  

R-DKE proposes a machine intelligence architecture capable of *instant deep research*,  
achieved by continuously compressing global knowledge into meaning representations,  
verifying truth states, and recursively deepening understanding through autonomous curiosity loops.

This framework outlines:

✅ Semantic knowledge atoms  
✅ Truth-graph epistemic memory  
✅ Autonomous self-questioning + exploration cycle  
✅ Pre-computed reasoning for millisecond answers  
✅ Transparent evidence + counter-view synthesis

### 🌿 R-DKE v2.0 — Physarum-Inspired Architecture
An evolution of R-DKE inspired by *Physarum polycephalum*,  
introducing adaptive reasoning loops where uncertainty acts as nutrient —  
allowing knowledge structures to grow, reinforce, or decay organically.

## 🌍 Vision

A shift from **reactive AI** → **proactive intelligence**

> “Not a system that waits to be asked.  
> A system that asks questions first.”

Future work will explore prototypes, evaluation metrics,  
and self-regulating safety systems for autonomous reasoning.
